AnisoDipFit Version 1.0
=========

Description
=========
The program AnisoDipFit was developed for the analysis of the Pulsed EPR Dipolar Spectroscopy (PDS) signals that correspond to spin systems consisting of one isotropic and one anisotropic S = 1/2 centers.

The program has three modes: simulation, fitting, and error analysis.

In the simulation mode, the PDS time trace / spectrum is simulated using the pre-defined geometric model of a spin system and the spectroscopic parameters of spin centers. 

In the fitting mode, the experimental PDS time trace / spectrum is fitted by means of genetic algorithm. In this case, the geometric model of a spin system is optimized until the simulated PDS time trace / spectrum provides the best fit to the experimental PDS time trace / spectrum.

In the error analysis mode, the errors of optimized fitting parameters are estimated.

Further description of the program can be found in the Manual and in the papers below.
